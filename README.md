Entry into the world of coding. Flynn lives!

Current job status: BASys IT support for McCarthy Tire Service. Normally need 24 ounces of coffee prior to functioning within normal parameters. Better after 36 ounces. 
I also help with supporting the fleet, but I spend the majority of my time in Excel for inventory and sales reporting.
